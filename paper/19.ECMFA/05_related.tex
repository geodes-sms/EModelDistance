In this section, we discuss first approaches for model differencing and second approaches which cluster models based on distance metrics. 


1) Comparing models. I am only aware of model difference approaches which produce differences and not distances. But I can enumerate here atomic diff approaches and domain-specific operation based diff approaches.


2) Clustering models. Mostly concerned with model repositories. Typical clustering distance metrics based on model features.
