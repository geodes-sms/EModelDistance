\es{as a subsection or a section on its own. This is where we can talk about implementation: MOMot, Henshin, Ecore, etc.}

The idea is to generate the optimizing search problem to be tailored for the domain. In this sense, we customize the fitness function based on a distance metric. 
Multi-objective genetic programming with an objective function to minimize for each distance metric.
We also need to minimize the number of rule applications: the number of rules to apply to get from M1 to M2. This distance is already taken into account in MOMot and returns a positive integer.
