In this paper we have introduced a novel notion of metrics for model comparison, so-called distance metrics. Furthermore, we defined a method to derive measurement tool support from the language definitions of modeling languages and have shown their usage in the recovery of operation-based change logs between two model versions. 

Heavily changing model structures seems to be a particular challenge to compute distance metrics. The used cases in our experiment have shown different performances of calculating and using model distances. As future work, we plan to perform more experiment with the refactoring cases where elements are deleted, created, and potentially re-created. Finally, we plan to use model distances for other model management tasks such as model synchronization where currently also often model differences are used to guide the synchronization process.
