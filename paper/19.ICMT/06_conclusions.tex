In this paper we have introduced a novel notion of metrics for model comparison, so-called domain-specific distance metrics. Moreover, we have defined a method to derive measurement tool support from the annotated language definitions of modeling languages, i.e., their metamodels, and have shown the usage the distance metrics in the recovery of operation-based change logs between model versions for different modeling languages.

One main result of our study is that heavily changing model structures seems to be a particular challenge when it comes to the computation of distance metrics. The cases used in our experiment have shown different performances of calculating and using model distances. As future work, we plan to perform more experiments with cases such as the refactoring case used in this paper where elements are deleted, created, and potentially re-created. Finally, we plan to use model distances for other model management tasks such as model synchronization or model/metamodel evolution where currently model differences are used in many existing approaches.
