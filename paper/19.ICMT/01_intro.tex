 
Motivation

A lot of research was invested in the last decade to develop differencing methods for models to identify the changes performed between two model versions.
A difference model captures these changes.

Objective

However, less attention was paid to distance computations of model versions. While different versions of a model may have a similar amount of differences,
the distance to a base model may be drastically different. 

Contributions

Therefore, we present in this paper distance metrics for models, a method to automatically generate tool support for computing domain-specific distance measures and show the benefits of distance measures over differences in searching for model evolution explanations. The results of running different experiments show...


This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview on the prerequisites of our approach and discuss the present gap between specifications for executing composite operations and for detecting applications of them as well as how this gap can be bridged. Our approach for detecting applications of composite operations is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we evaluate the correctness and completeness of our implementation and investigate the scalability and performance of our implementation in Section 5. In Section 6, we survey related work and in Section 7, we conclude with a short summary and possible extensions of the presented work.
