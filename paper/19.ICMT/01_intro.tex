With the emergence of model-driven engineering~\cite{}, the need for dedicated techniques for management models arose. In particular, a lot of research was invested in the last decade to develop differencing methods for models to identify the changes performed between two model versions. Different algorithms for computing differences as well as several representations of differences have been proposed. Difference models which capture the changes between model versions have been used in different cases such as model co-evolution, versioning or synchronization. 
Thus, difference models represent an important artefact kind in model-driven engineering. 

While differences have been in the focus, less attention was paid to distance computations of model versions. Distances may be useful because of several reasons. First, while different versions of a model may have a similar or even same amount of differences, the distance to a base model may be drastically different. Second, distances may be an additional metric to consider the evolution paths of models to reach a certain setting. As an example consider the movement of attributes between different classes. If we have classes A, B, C, D all connected in sequence with an association, and move an attribute from A to another class, we may always have the same difference: attribute deleted in A and added to one of the other classes. However, a distance metric could tell us how far we have moved the attribute by getting a different distance measure if the attribute ends up in class B, C, or D.  

In order to provide additional measures for understanding how much a model has changed, we present in this paper distance metrics for models. In addition, we present a method to automatically generate tool support for computing domain-specific distance measures from an annotated version of the metamodel of the language used for defining the models. Finally, we show the benefits of using distance measures over differences in searching for model evolution explanations. Specifically, the results of running different experiments show...

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview on the background of our approach and discuss the present gap between differences and distances. Our approach for generating tool support for computing domain-specific distance measures from metamodels is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we evaluate the effectiveness of domain-specific distance measures for the particular case of computing model evolution explanations in terms of domain-specific change operations. In Section 5, we survey related work and in Section 6, we conclude with a short summary and an outlook on future work.
